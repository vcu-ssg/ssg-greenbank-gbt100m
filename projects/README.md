# Projects folder

This folder holds projects created by the Makefile system.

A project stores images, point clouds and gaussian splats in a folder structure 
specific to the tools.

Here is an example:


DJI_0146-png_base_1.60_1600
├── images
├── colmap
│   └── sparse
│       └── 0
└── gsplat
    └── point_cloud
        └── iteration_30000
