This folder contains the source MP4.

These files are NOT stored in the repo.  After cloning the repo you'll need to download the files to this folder.

A Makefile is included in the folder:

    make local-mp4-files

The script assumes that you have `rclone` installed and the appropropriate folder has been shared with your google drive account.
