### ✅ What you can do immediately:

1. Unzip:

   ```bash
   unzip greenbank_pipeline_starter.zip
   cd greenbank_pipeline
   ```

2. Drop your MP4s into `/mp4s`

3. Install dependencies (if not yet):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg colmap meshlab blender
# Optional: build OpenMVG + OpenMVS — see README.md for build instructions
```

4. Run the pipeline:

   ```bash
   python3 pipeline.py
   ```

5. View outputs:

   ```bash
   ./view_in_meshlab.sh
   # or
   blender --python view_in_blender.py
   ```

6. Or try the OpenMVG path:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_openmvg_sfm.sh
   ./scripts/convert_openmvg_to_openmvs.sh
   ```

### 📌 Reminder

Edit `config.yaml` to:

* Set `fps: 1` or `fps: 0.5` for your MP4s
* Choose `use_openmvg: true` to use OpenMVG
* Choose `use_colmap: true` to use COLMAP

Let me know once you've unzipped and run a test. I can help:

✅ Tune OpenMVS parameters
✅ Walk through OpenMVG results
✅ Enable full containerized version next (Docker-based pipeline)

Happy photogrammetry! 🚀
Let me know how it runs.
