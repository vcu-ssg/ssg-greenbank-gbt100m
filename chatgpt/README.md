# ChatGPT Folder

This folder contains clips from ChatGPT instructions and other references.

Here is a starter Medium article:  <https://medium.com/@lienghongky/sfm-3d-reconstruction-with-openmvg-and-openmvs-1ad81c3743d0>

The article highlights a pipeline including OpenMVG (Open Multiple View Geometry) as a preprocessor for OpenMVS (Open Multiple View Stereo).  ChatGPT recommended COLMAP rather than OpenMVG.
